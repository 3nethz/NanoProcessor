# NanoProcessor
This repo contains the design of a simple "nanoprocessor." It includes VHDL implementations of key components: a 4-bit Add/Subtract unit, 3-bit adder, Program Counter, and various k-way b-bit multiplexers. These components combine to create a basic processor capable of executing a set of simple instructions.
